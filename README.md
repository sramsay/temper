# temper

Version 1.1.0

## Frequently Unasked Questions

### Is this the program I'm looking for?

Probably not.

### What does this program do?

It's a command-line program for UNIX-like systems that converts from Fahrenheit to Celsius and vice versa.  So if you type:

	temper 23

It will give you:

	23.0째F is -5.0째C
	23.0째C is 73.4째F

### Doesn't [GNU units](https://www.gnu.org/software/units/) already do that?

Yes.

### So why did you write this thing?

As an American, I am completely illiterate when it comes to the metric system.  It often happens, though, that I'm in a chatroom or something and one of my friends (who is living in some exotic locale like Ottawa) will say, "It's -4 degrees outside!"  Which sounds insanely cold to me.  But armed with `temper`, I can say, "Cry me a river.  That's not that cold."

### What do I need to compile this program?

You need a reasonably modern C++ compiler.  You also need to have `meson`, `ninja`, and `boost` installed (all three of which are almost certainly available through the package manager of whatever distribution you're using; the last one is probaby alfready installed).

### How do I compile this program?

From the `temper` directory, type:

	$ meson build
	$ cd build
	$ ninja
	$ ninja install

You might need to be root for that last part.  

### So let me get this straight.  You wrote over a hundred lines of code in C++ &mdash; with friggin' Boost as a dependency &mdash; to do something this stupid?

Yes.  Aside from the pressing need for such a thing, I also wanted to play around with [meson](https://mesonbuild.com/) and [ninja](https://ninja-build.org/).  At the time, I was thinking of using those on larger projects, and wanted to get my head around them on a tiny project first.  They're both awesome, by the way.

Every discussion of `boost` on the internet seems to begin with, "Well, if you're okay using boost . . ."  

I am.  When `temper` becomes a mission-critical piece of software on the International Space Station, I will rewrite the whole thing in ANSI C.  On earth, however, `boost` is everywhere, and it makes life easier most of the time.

Oh, and temper proved very useful when building [wwo](https://github.com/sramsay/wwo), which is a much more interesting and useful program.

### Couldn't you have written this in, like, one line of Ruby/Python/JavaScript with no dependencies?

Probably.

### Couldn't you have written an immaculately pure, provably correct version of this in Idris/Haskell/Coq?

Probably.

### Shouldn't everything be written in Rust?

Probably not.

### Why not do Kelvin?!

How long must I endure [you people](https://units.fandom.com/wiki/Kelvin)?

Yeah, it'd probably be cool.  On the other hand, my friends were all humanities majors, so when they say, "It's 10 degrees!" they are definitely not talking about some substance being miraculously held at -263.15&deg;C.  

And why stop there?  What about the Rankine scale?  Or Isaac Newton's scale (devised in 1701) by which one may speak of the *Calor aeris hyberni ubi aqua incipit gelu rigescere* ("the heat of air in winter at which water begins to freeze").  My humanities friends are, after all, way better at Latin.

I don't know.  Maybe version 2.

### You sound like a jerk.  Are you some kind of imperial-system zealot or something like that?

Nah, I think the metric system is way more rational, and it's the system used by most people the world over.  I wish we (Americans, Libyans, Belizeans, and Myanmars) would switch.  There's perhaps some hope for those last three, but the first seem curiously intractable on this point.
